/**
 * Brings a user's study programme memberships in line with what Feide reports about them.
 *
 * Every programme Feide reports is upserted, and the user is added to the ones Feide has not
 * reported for them before. That last part is what makes manual membership possible: Feide keeps
 * reporting a programme whether anyone acts on it or not, so adding on every login would put a
 * membership an administrator removed straight back. Which programmes have been acted on is
 * remembered per user, and only the ones seen for the first time are added.
 *
 * A programme the user has *left* is still not deactivated here: this only ever adds. Feide is not
 * treated as the whole truth about a user, since a membership may also have been granted by hand.
 *
 * @returns the user's study programmes as they are stored, so the caller can reason about them.
